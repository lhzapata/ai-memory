# MCP install guide - additional clients

> All snippets below default to `http://127.0.0.1:49374` (local server). For a
> remote server (homelab, LAN box) substitute the appropriate URL AND add an
> `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to the `headers` block when bearer auth
> is enabled. The MCP wire protocol expects the `/mcp` path suffix on the URL.

> **Transport is stateless by default.** Since v0.1.2 the HTTP transport
> answers each request independently (plain JSON, no `Mcp-Session-Id`
> required), so any client that points a remote URL at `/mcp` — including
> OpenCode `type: "remote"` and plain `curl` — works without an
> `mcp-remote` stdio shim (issue #3). The `mcp-remote` bridge is still
> needed for **Claude Desktop** specifically, because its config only
> supports stdio servers — not because of session state. If you run a
> client that *requires* MCP session continuity or server-initiated SSE
> streams, start the server with `ai-memory serve --transport http
> --http-stateful` to restore rmcp's session mode.

This page documents how to register ai-memory as an MCP server with
agent CLIs beyond the README quick start.

Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Devin CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, Grok Build CLI, Zero, OpenClaw, OpenCode, and
OMP have automatic capture integrations (shell/PowerShell hooks for
Claude Code / Codex / Devin CLI / Cursor / Gemini CLI / Antigravity CLI / Grok Build CLI, TypeScript plugin/extension
files for OpenClaw / OpenCode / OMP) and are covered in the
[main README](../README.md#quick-start). On native Windows, Claude Code uses
Git Bash `.sh` hooks rather than the PowerShell default used by other
script-hook agents. Grok and Zero capture lifecycle events, but both ignore
SessionStart stdout, so ai-memory does not auto-inject handoffs for them.
SessionStart handoff injection works only for clients that consume startup-hook
stdout (or their equivalent context-injection result); Grok and Zero must call
`memory_handoff_accept` when resuming.

Claude Desktop and VS Code Copilot are **MCP-only** here: they expose
long-term memory to their LLMs via ai-memory's MCP tools
(`memory_query`, `memory_recent`, `memory_handoff_accept`, etc.), but
they do not auto-capture session events into ai-memory's `/hook`
endpoint. The trade-off:

| | What you get | What you don't get |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP only** | LLM can query the wiki, accept handoffs, run memory_consolidate, and run `memory_auto_improve` learning reviews | No automatic session-end summaries; no auto-handoff at session boundaries |
| **MCP + hooks** | All of the above *plus* every prompt/tool-call captured automatically; handoffs surface at SessionStart with no human prompting **only when the client consumes startup-hook output or an equivalent context-injection result** | Grok and Zero discard SessionStart stdout; ask them to call `memory_handoff_accept` when resuming. |

For MCP-only use, you can still cover the session-boundary gap by asking
the LLM to call `memory_handoff_begin` manually before quitting.

For proactive tool use in MCP-capable clients that read project instructions,
also install the managed routing package from
[`docs/usage.md`](usage.md#install-the-routing-snippet-and-agent-skills). The
slim instruction block stays in the agent rules file, while supported Agent
Skills carry the detailed ai-memory tool-routing guidance.

## Custom lifecycle bridges

Built-in integrations should use `ai-memory install-hooks` rather than
calling `/hook` directly. For a third-party bridge that has its own
lifecycle vocabulary, keep the core `event` query param on one of
ai-memory's canonical events when possible:

### Community-maintained Hermes Agent plugin

ai-memory does not currently ship a first-party Hermes Agent installer,
but a community-maintained
[`ai-memory-hermes-plugin`](https://github.com/MrLuciano/ai-memory-hermes-plugin)
is available. Treat it as a third-party bridge: verify the plugin's
documented Hermes and ai-memory version matrix, install/update/uninstall
behavior, platform coverage, and secret handling before enabling it on a
live ai-memory server. In particular, bearer tokens and endpoint settings
should stay in environment or local config references rather than generated
plugin source files.

The same lifecycle guidance below applies to Hermes or any other external
bridge: map known events onto ai-memory's canonical hook events where
possible, and use extension metadata for source-specific events instead of
expanding ai-memory's stored event enum for one client.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'http://127.0.0.1:49374/hook?event=user-prompt&agent=other' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"session_id":"sess-123","cwd":"/repo","prompt":"Fix auth"}'
```

If the source event has no canonical equivalent, opt in to extension
metadata instead of asking ai-memory to expand its stored event enum:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'http://127.0.0.1:49374/hook?event=lead.contact&agent=other&extension=fstech' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"session_id":"sess-123","title":"Lead contacted","message":"Lead Maria requested a proposal"}'
```

With `extension=<namespace>`, unknown events are still stored as the
canonical `other` observation kind, but ai-memory also preserves the
validated source event. You may pass `source_event=<name>` explicitly;
otherwise an unknown `event` value becomes the source event. Both tokens
must be ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, or `:`; namespaces are
limited to 64 bytes and source-event names to 128 bytes. Unknown events
without `extension` intentionally collapse to `other` with no source
metadata.

> **One-shot tip:** every snippet below is also reachable from the
> CLI:
> ```bash
> ai-memory install-mcp --client gemini-cli   # or cursor / claude-desktop / openclaw / omp / pi / antigravity-cli / grok / vscode-copilot
> ```

---

## Cursor

**Status:** ✅ MCP supported. ✅ Lifecycle hooks supported via
`ai-memory install-hooks --agent cursor --apply`.

**Config file:**
- Per-project: `.cursor/mcp.json` in the workspace root.
- Global: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-memory": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:49374/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Gotchas:**
- Cursor uses the `url` key for HTTP/SSE transports. Stdio uses
  `command` + `args` instead.
- Cursor hooks live in `~/.cursor/hooks.json` or `.cursor/hooks.json`.
  ai-memory maps `sessionStart`, `sessionEnd`, `beforeSubmitPrompt`,
  `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `postToolUseFailure`, `preCompact`, and
  `stop` to the shared capture path.
- Cursor watches `hooks.json` on save. For MCP config changes, restart
  Cursor or toggle the server off+on in **Settings → MCP**.
- Sources: <https://cursor.com/docs/mcp>, <https://cursor.com/docs/hooks.md>

---

## VS Code GitHub Copilot

**Status:** ✅ MCP supported (workspace-default). ❌ No lifecycle hooks
(Copilot's agent mode does not expose `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` /
`SessionStart` yet, so ai-memory's automatic capture is not active in
VS Code — call `memory_query`, `memory_write_page`, etc. from chat).

**Config file:**
- Workspace (recommended): `.vscode/mcp.json` in the repo root. Matches
  ai-memory's per-cwd auto-scoping.
- User profile: run **MCP: Open User Configuration** in VS Code and use
  the `mcp.json` file it opens. The exact path is platform- and
  profile-specific; pass it to `--config-file` if you want ai-memory to
  write that file directly.

**Schema (verified against VS Code's MCP reference):** top-level key is
`servers` (NOT `mcpServers`). HTTP endpoints use `type: "http"` and the
`url` field; the bearer token goes into an inline `headers` object.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "ai-memory": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:49374/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**With a bearer token** (rendered when `--auth-token` is passed):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "ai-memory": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:49374/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Install command:**

```bash
# Print the snippet:
ai-memory install-mcp --client vscode-copilot

# Or write .vscode/mcp.json in the current workspace directly:
ai-memory install-mcp --client vscode-copilot --apply

# Or write the user-profile mcp.json opened by VS Code directly:
ai-memory install-mcp --client vscode-copilot \
  --config-file /path/to/vscode-profile/mcp.json --apply
```

Aliases: `copilot`, `github-copilot`.

**Gotchas:**
- The top-level key must be `servers`. The `mcpServers` form (used by
  Claude Code / Cursor / Gemini CLI) is silently ignored by VS Code.
- After editing, open the MCP view in the Extensions sidebar and start
  the server (or use **MCP: Show installed servers**). VS Code does not
  auto-reload `.vscode/mcp.json` while the window is focused on another
  tab.
- Copilot Enterprise behaves the same as Copilot Individual/Business
  for MCP — your org may restrict which MCP servers Copilot is allowed
  to call; check **Settings → Copilot → MCP servers** if the server
  shows as blocked.
- Lifecycle hooks aren't possible until VS Code Copilot adds an agent
  hook surface. Until then, the auto-handoff flow that other agents
  enjoy (SessionStart auto-fetches a "where you left off" block) does
  not run here — ask the agent to call `memory_handoff_accept`
  manually if you want it.

## Claude Desktop

**Status:** ✅ MCP supported (via stdio shim for HTTP). ❌ No lifecycle hooks.

**Config file:**
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: not officially distributed by Anthropic. Use Claude Code
  (terminal) instead.

**Important:** Claude Desktop's JSON config supports stdio MCP
servers only. To talk to ai-memory's HTTP endpoint, bridge through
the community [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote)
stdio shim. Requires Node.js installed on the same machine.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:49374/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Gotchas:**
- After editing the config, **fully quit and relaunch** Claude
  Desktop. "Check for Updates…" is not enough.
- Claude Desktop also has account-level remote custom connectors and
  `.mcpb` desktop extensions. The ai-memory CLI manages the local
  JSON-config path because it works with localhost/LAN servers and does
  not require publishing an HTTPS connector.
- Claude Desktop exposes MCP tools but no lifecycle hooks, so automatic
  prompt/tool capture and session-boundary handoffs are not possible
  unless Anthropic adds a desktop hook/plugin surface.
- If the MCP indicator doesn't appear after restart, check the logs:
  `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\`
  (Windows).

## Gemini CLI

**Status:** ✅ MCP supported. ✅ Lifecycle hooks supported via
`ai-memory install-hooks --agent gemini-cli --apply`.

**Config file:**
- User: `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- Project: `.gemini/settings.json`

Gemini CLI uses `httpUrl` (not `url`) for streamable-HTTP MCP
endpoints. The `timeout` is in milliseconds.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-memory": {
      "httpUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:49374/mcp",
      "timeout": 5000
    }
  }
}
```

**Hooks:**

```bash
ai-memory install-hooks --agent gemini-cli --apply
```

Gemini CLI's lifecycle event names differ from Claude Code's, so use
`install-hooks --agent gemini-cli` rather than copying another agent's
settings. ai-memory maps Gemini's `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`,
`BeforeTool`, `AfterTool`, and `PreCompress` events to the shared hook
capture path; `SessionStart` also fetches pending handoffs.

**Gotchas:**
- Gemini supports stdio too via `command`/`args`, plus SSE via `url`.
  Only `httpUrl` covers streamable HTTP. Don't mix them in one entry.
- Restart the CLI session after changing `~/.gemini/settings.json` so
  both MCP servers and hooks are reloaded.

## Antigravity CLI (`agy`)

**Status:** ✅ MCP supported. ✅ Lifecycle hooks supported via
`ai-memory install-hooks --agent antigravity-cli --apply`.

**Config file (MCP):** `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/mcp_config.json`

Antigravity CLI is the successor to Gemini CLI, built in Go with
parallel subagent support. It uses a separate `mcp_config.json`
(instead of Gemini CLI's combined `settings.json`) and uses
`serverUrl` (not `httpUrl`) for streamable-HTTP endpoints.

```bash
# One-shot via CLI:
ai-memory install-mcp --client antigravity-cli
```

The rendered snippet writes to `mcp_config.json` under `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-memory": {
      "serverUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:49374/mcp",
      "timeout": 5000
    }
  }
}
```

**Config file (hooks):** `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`

Antigravity CLI uses a named-groups hook format. Each top-level key
is a hook group name; inside, event arrays map to handlers. Tool
events (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`) use nested shape with matcher;
lifecycle events (`PreInvocation`, `Stop`) use flat shape.

```bash
# One-shot via CLI:
ai-memory install-hooks --agent antigravity-cli --apply
```

The rendered hooks config looks like:

```json
{
  "ai-memory": {
    "PreInvocation": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "AI_MEMORY_HOOK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:49374 /path/to/session-start.sh"
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "AI_MEMORY_HOOK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:49374 /path/to/pre-tool-use.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "AI_MEMORY_HOOK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:49374 /path/to/post-tool-use.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "AI_MEMORY_HOOK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:49374 /path/to/stop.sh"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Gotchas:**
- Antigravity CLI uses `serverUrl` for HTTP MCP endpoints, not `url`
  or `httpUrl`. The `--apply` flag writes the correct key.
- Hook scripts are staged under `~/.local/share/ai-memory/hooks/antigravity-cli/`.
- The `PreInvocation` event fires before each model call (not just at
  session start). ai-memory uses it as the closest equivalent to Gemini
  CLI's `SessionStart`; when a pending handoff exists, the hook injects
  it via Antigravity's `injectSteps[].ephemeralMessage` output.
- Antigravity CLI does not expose a true session-end hook. `Stop` records
  a stop observation only; call `memory_handoff_begin` before quitting when
  you need the next agent to receive a handoff.

## Zero (Gitlawb/zero)

Zero manages MCP servers in `~/.config/zero/config.json`
(`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zero/config.json` on non-default XDG setups) under an
`mcp.servers` map, with native HTTP transport + bearer headers:

```bash
ai-memory install-mcp --client zero --apply \
    --server-url "http://homelab:49374/mcp" --auth-token "$TOKEN"
```

which merges:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "ai-memory": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "http://homelab:49374/mcp",
        "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Lifecycle capture is separate and script-free: `ai-memory install-hooks
--agent zero --apply` merges exec-form entries (the native `ai-memory hook`
command + args, JSON payload on stdin — no shell) into
`~/.config/zero/hooks.json`, covering `sessionStart`/`sessionEnd`/
`beforeTool`/`afterTool` plus `specialistStart`/`specialistStop` (mapped to
ai-memory's subagent events). Zero discards `sessionStart` hook stdout, so
capture and session-end handoff *creation* work, but handoff *injection*
does not — ask Zero to call `memory_handoff_accept` at the start of a
resumed session.

## Grok Build CLI

**Status:** ✅ MCP supported. ✅ Lifecycle hooks supported via
`ai-memory install-hooks --agent grok --apply`. ❌ No automatic handoff
injection (Grok ignores SessionStart stdout — same policy as Zero).

**Config file:** `install-mcp --client grok --apply` writes the user config at
`$GROK_HOME/config.toml` (default `~/.grok/config.toml`). To use a project or
custom config file, pass its exact path with `--config-file`; the CLI does not
infer a project config location. Provide the MCP URL and token explicitly for
that lane, and remove a custom config entry manually when uninstalling.

```bash
ai-memory install-mcp --client grok --apply \
    --server-url "http://homelab:49374/mcp" --auth-token "$TOKEN"
```

which merges:

```toml
[mcp_servers.ai-memory]
url = "http://homelab:49374/mcp"
enabled = true

[mcp_servers.ai-memory.headers]
Authorization = "Bearer <token>"
```

**Schema notes (do not confuse with Codex):**
- Grok uses `[mcp_servers.<name>.headers]`; Codex uses `http_headers`.
- `enabled = true` is the documented per-server toggle.
- String fields support `${VAR}` expansion, so you can write
  `Authorization = "Bearer ${AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN}"` instead of embedding
  the token.
- CLI alternative: `grok mcp add --transport http ai-memory <url>` (plus
  `--header` for bearer auth).

Lifecycle capture is separate: `ai-memory install-hooks --agent grok
--apply` writes `$GROK_HOME/hooks/ai-memory.json` (default
`~/.grok/hooks/ai-memory.json`; Grok discovers every
`$GROK_HOME/hooks/*.json`, so third-party hook files stay untouched). Events
mirror Claude Code's vocabulary (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`,
`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`, `Stop`, `SessionEnd`,
`SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`) with a Grok-specific script bundle /
native `ai-memory hook --event … --agent grok` commands. Session-end
handoff *creation* works; handoff *injection* does not — ask Grok to
call `memory_handoff_accept` (or install the managed routing skills under
`.grok/skills` / `$GROK_HOME/skills` (default `~/.grok/skills`)) at the start
of a resumed session.

Grok can also load MCP from Claude Code / Cursor compat sources when those
compat flags are enabled, but first-party `install-mcp --client grok` is
the supported path for uninstall isolation and hooks URL inference.

## Devin CLI

Devin manages MCP servers in `~/.devin/config.json` under `mcpServers`:

```bash
ai-memory install-mcp --client devin --apply \
    --server-url "http://homelab:49374/mcp" --auth-token "$TOKEN"
```

which merges:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-memory": {
      "url": "http://homelab:49374/mcp",
      "transport": "http",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

Lifecycle capture is separate:

```bash
ai-memory install-hooks --agent devin --apply \
    --server-url "http://homelab:49374" --auth-token "$TOKEN"
```

By default this writes `~/.devin/hooks.v1.json`, whose root object is the
event map. If you want the hook entries inside `~/.devin/config.json` instead,
pass that path with `--config-file`; ai-memory then merges them under the
`hooks` key.

Devin's supported lifecycle events are `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`,
`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PostCompaction`, `Stop`, and `SessionEnd`.
`PostCompaction` is a Devin post-compaction event with a `summary` field; it is
not Claude Code's `PreCompact`. Devin does not currently expose subagent
start/stop hooks, so there is no Devin subagent capture surface to install.

Session-start handoff injection is built in: the generated Devin SessionStart
hook returns `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` when a pending handoff is
available.

Real Devin hook payloads may omit `session_id` and `cwd`; the installed hooks
fill both in:

- **cwd** — the payload's `cwd` wins when present, then the
  `DEVIN_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable (when Devin's launcher provides
  it), then the hook process working directory.
- **session id** — when the payload has none, the hook mints one at
  `SessionStart`, stores it in a single per-host slot
  (`<data-dir>/hook-state/devin-session-id`), reuses it for every later
  event, and clears it at `SessionEnd`. Set `AI_MEMORY_SESSION_ID` in the
  hook environment to pin an externally managed run id instead. Because the
  slot is per host+agent, two Devin sessions running *concurrently* on the
  same machine share it — the newest `SessionStart` wins and earlier
  sessions' remaining events are attributed to it (same graceful-degradation
  stance as the single-slot `/handoff` fallback). A payload that does carry
  its own `session_id` always wins over both.

## OpenClaw

**Status:** ✅ MCP supported. ✅ Lifecycle hooks supported via a native
OpenClaw plugin generated by `ai-memory install-hooks --agent openclaw --apply`.

**Config file:** `~/.openclaw/config.json` (the OpenClaw docs reference
this path indirectly; verify with your `openclaw config show`).

OpenClaw distinguishes transports explicitly. Use
`"transport": "streamable-http"` for ai-memory's HTTP endpoint.

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "ai-memory": {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:49374/mcp",
        "transport": "streamable-http"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Gotchas:**
- `install-hooks --agent openclaw --apply` writes a local plugin package
  under ai-memory's data dir, then runs `openclaw plugins install --link
  <dir> --force` when the `openclaw` CLI is on `PATH`. If the CLI is not
  available, it prints the exact install command.
- The plugin registers OpenClaw `session_start`, `session_end`,
  `before_prompt_build`, `before_tool_call`, `after_tool_call`,
  `before_compaction`, and `agent_end` hooks. `before_prompt_build`
  injects pending handoffs via OpenClaw's `prependContext` hook result.
- Plugin installs or updates require a Gateway restart unless your
  managed OpenClaw Gateway auto-restarts after plugin source changes.

## Oh My Pi / OMP

**Status:** ✅ MCP supported via `install-mcp --client omp` (or
`--client oh-my-pi`). ✅ Lifecycle capture supported via
`ai-memory install-hooks --agent omp --apply` (or `--agent oh-my-pi`).

**Config file:**
- User: `~/.omp/agent/mcp.json`
- Project: `.omp/mcp.json`

The current Oh My Pi package exposes the `omp` binary and native
`.omp` config directories. Use `omp` (or `oh-my-pi`) for this integration;
real `pi` is recognized separately and uses the generated bridge extension below.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-memory": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:49374/mcp",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Lifecycle extension:**

```bash
ai-memory install-hooks --agent omp --apply
# or: ai-memory install-hooks --agent oh-my-pi --apply
```

This writes `~/.omp/agent/extensions/ai-memory.ts`, which OMP discovers
as a direct TypeScript extension on startup. Restart `omp` after
installing or changing the file.

**Gotchas:**
- OMP extensions are TypeScript modules, not shell hooks; stdout is not
  used for context injection.
- The extension uses OMP lifecycle events for prompt/tool capture and
  `before_agent_start` to inject pending ai-memory handoffs.

## Pi

**Status:** ✅ MCP and lifecycle capture supported via generated bridge
extension. Pi has no native `mcp.json`; use `install-hooks --agent pi --apply`
to write `~/.pi/agent/extensions/ai-memory.ts`.

```bash
ai-memory install-hooks --agent pi --apply
```

The generated extension posts lifecycle events to `/hook`, fetches pending
handoffs in `before_agent_start`, initializes ai-memory's HTTP `/mcp` endpoint,
lists tools, and registers each one with `pi.registerTool`. `install-mcp
--client pi` intentionally prints this bridge guidance instead of writing an
ignored `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`.

OMP / Oh My Pi remains separate: use `--client omp` / `--agent omp` (or
`oh-my-pi`) for `.omp` paths.

---

## After registering MCP - verify it works

Regardless of which client you used, the first sanity check is the
same: ask the model to list its available MCP tools, or to call
`memory_status` explicitly.

```
You: List the MCP tools you can call. Use one of them to check
     ai-memory's status.

Model (any client): I can call: memory_query, memory_recent,
     memory_status, memory_briefing, memory_explore,
     memory_handoff_accept, memory_handoff_begin, memory_handoff_cancel,
     memory_consolidate, memory_auto_improve, memory_write_page, memory_read_page, memory_delete_page,
     memory_lint, memory_forget_sweep, memory_install_self_routing.
     memory_status reports: 0 pages, 0 observations, 0 sessions.
```

If the model sees the tools but does not call them proactively, refresh the
managed routing package. The `memory_install_self_routing` tool is read-only:
it returns the slim markered instruction block, marker strings, agent filename
hints, managed skill payloads (`name`, `description`, `relative_path`,
`content`), and authoritative project/global target hints for `.claude/skills`,
`.agents/skills`, `.grok/skills`, and `$GROK_HOME/skills` (default
`~/.grok/skills`), plus overwrite guidance. Agents should use their own file
editing tools to write those artifacts while preserving unrelated user content.

If the model doesn't see any of those tools, the MCP registration
isn't being picked up. Check:

1. **Is the server running?** `curl http://127.0.0.1:49374/mcp` should
   return a JSON-RPC error (not a connection refused). If refused,
   start ai-memory: `docker start ai-memory` or
   `ai-memory serve --transport http`.
2. **Did the client reload the config?** Claude Desktop and OMP need a
   restart. Cursor watches hooks but usually needs MCP reload/toggle.
   OpenClaw plugin changes need a Gateway restart unless it auto-restarted.
3. **Are you on the right port?** ai-memory's default is **49374**
   (`0xC0DE` in hex). If you remapped, update the URL in every
   client's config.

If the model sees the tools but they all error, the server is
probably running in a different data dir than expected. Check
`docker logs ai-memory` or `ai-memory status --json` for the data
dir on disk.

## When does the auto-handoff actually work?

The cross-agent handoff feature (the "headline" pitch in the README)
requires both sides - the agent that *ends* a session, and the agent
that *starts* the next one - to play nicely with ai-memory:

| Side | What's needed | Covered by |
|---|---|---|
| **Ending side** | The agent must create a handoff, either through a true session-end hook, the supported Codex manual finalizer, or by calling `memory_handoff_begin`. | Built-in automatically for Claude Code, Devin CLI, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Grok Build CLI, Zero, OpenClaw, OpenCode, and OMP. Codex has no reliable true session-end event, so run `ai-memory finalize-session` when you need the final summary/handoff/auto-improve eligibility. Antigravity CLI has no true session-end event in the current integration, so ask it to call `memory_handoff_begin` before quitting when you need a handoff. |
| **Starting side** | Either (a) the session-start/plugin path injects the handoff via `/handoff`, OR (b) the model proactively calls `memory_handoff_accept` on first turn. | (a) is built-in for Claude Code / Codex / Devin CLI / Cursor / Gemini CLI / Antigravity CLI / OpenClaw / OpenCode / OMP. It requires a client that consumes startup-hook stdout or an equivalent context-injection result. Grok and Zero are explicitly excluded because they discard SessionStart stdout; use (b). (b) works for any MCP-capable client if you nudge the model - see [the managed routing package](usage.md#install-the-routing-snippet-and-agent-skills). |

OpenCode uses its official `session.deleted` plugin event for true session-end
delivery. Its generated plugin also sends a deduped best-effort close for any
still-active sessions from `dispose` during normal plugin teardown; abrupt
process exits can still lose that fallback, so `session.deleted` remains the
primary close path.

Codex `Stop` is not a session end. The Codex hook install intentionally omits
`SessionEnd`; `ai-memory finalize-session` finds the latest open Codex session
for the current workspace/project and posts a synthetic `session-end` event
through the same server path as real hook clients. Use `--all` only when you
want to close every matching open Codex session in that scope.

So a typical mixed workflow looks like:

- **Claude Code → Cursor.** Claude Code's `SessionEnd` creates the
  handoff automatically. Cursor's `sessionStart` hook fetches and
  prepends it when `install-hooks --agent cursor --apply` is installed.
- **Claude Desktop → Claude Code.** Claude Desktop doesn't write a
  handoff (no hooks). To resume in Claude Code, you'd have had to
  call `memory_handoff_begin` manually in Claude Desktop before
  quitting. ai-memory's wiki content via `memory_query` is still
  available either way.
