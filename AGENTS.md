## Long-term memory (ai-memory)

This project uses [ai-memory](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-memory)
for cross-session continuity. **Lifecycle hooks already capture every
prompt + tool call automatically.** You never need to manually write
routine notes; the SessionStart hook auto-fetches pending handoffs and
the SessionEnd hook auto-consolidates. Only write a durable wiki page
when the user explicitly asks to remember or annotate something
permanently.

### When to reach for each tool

The user can express any of the intents below in plain English —
match the intent to the tool. They do not need to name the tool.

| User says / situation | Tool |
|---|---|
| "have we discussed X?" / "search memory for Y" / before proposing architecture | `memory_query` |
| "what's been going on" / "show recent activity" (light) | `memory_recent` |
| "is ai-memory healthy?" / "how big is the wiki?" | `memory_status` |
| "give me the stats" / structured snapshot for the agent to consume | `memory_briefing` (read-only; never creates handoffs) |
| "catch me up" / "I've been away" / "what's important right now?" / open-ended exploration | `memory_explore` |
| "where did we leave off?" — and you see a `📥 ai-memory: pending handoff` block in your context | already done — answer from that block; do NOT re-call `memory_handoff_accept` |
| "where did we leave off?" — and no such block is visible | `memory_handoff_accept` (rare; the SessionStart hook usually got there first) |
| "save context for the next session" / wrapping up / ending this session | `memory_handoff_begin` (session-end only; do **not** use for status/briefing; single-use handoff; terse summary; put detail in `open_questions` + `next_steps` bullets) |
| "discard that handoff" / "I created a handoff by mistake" | `memory_handoff_cancel` (requires exact `handoff_id` from `memory_handoff_begin`; marks it expired before the next session sees it) |
| "consolidate this session" / "compile what we learned" (usually automatic) | `memory_consolidate` |
| "remember this permanently" / "save a note" / "add an annotation" / durable project knowledge | `memory_write_page` (write a wiki page; do **not** use handoff for permanent notes) |
| "audit the wiki" / "find contradictions" / "what rules should we add?" | `memory_lint` |
| "prune old pages" / "memory cleanup" | `memory_forget_sweep` |

`memory_explore` is the right default for the "I want to know what's
going on" use case — it returns a prose digest whose verbosity
scales automatically to how long it's been since the last activity
(< 1 h → one line; > 30 days → full catchup).

### When you write a project rule, write it here

If you're about to write a durable project rule ("always X", "never
Y", "all PRs must …"), this rules file (CLAUDE.md for Claude Code;
AGENTS.md for Codex / OpenCode / Cursor / Gemini CLI; whichever
convention your agent uses) is where it belongs. ai-memory's lint
pass surfaces the same hint automatically when a `kind: rule` page
lands in `_rules/`.

### Refreshing this snippet

This block is maintained by ai-memory. Two ways to refresh it with
the latest binary's recommended copy:

- **From the agent** (no terminal needed): ask "refresh the ai-memory
  routing in this project" — the agent calls
  `memory_install_self_routing`, picks the right filename for itself
  (Claude Code → `CLAUDE.md`; Codex / OpenCode / Cursor / Gemini →
  `AGENTS.md`), and uses its Write / Edit tool to land the block.
- **From the CLI**: `ai-memory install-instructions` (defaults to
  `CLAUDE.md`; pass `--target AGENTS.md` for non-Claude agents).

Both are idempotent: re-runs replace the block bracketed by
`<!-- ai-memory:start -->` / `<!-- ai-memory:end -->` markers
without disturbing the rest of the file.
<!-- ai-memory:end -->

## Project Maintenance Rules

- When a change affects user-visible behavior, installation, supported
  platforms, supported agents, providers, or deployment, update
  `CHANGELOG.md` and the README/docs support references in the same commit.
- Do not bump crate/package versions or cut release tags automatically after
  every merged PR. Ask the user before any version bump or release tag.
- When asked to evaluate a PR, report the pros, cons, and recommended fix,
  then ask the user for approval before merging or pushing PR changes. Do not
  merge PRs during evaluation unless the user explicitly approves that action.
- When the MCP tool surface changes, update `MEMORY_INSTRUCTIONS`,
  `ai_memory_core::SNIPPET_BODY`, README/docs tool references, and regression
  tests that assert every tool appears in both prompt surfaces.

## Rust Engineering Rules

- Prefer small, behavior-preserving changes. Do not add compatibility
  branches, new abstractions, or new public surface unless a shipped caller,
  persisted data, or explicit requirement needs them.
- Optimize the real bottleneck class first: algorithm, query shape, batching,
  allocation count, IO boundaries, and container choice. Avoid clever
  micro-optimizations without evidence.
- Keep SQLite writes behind the single writer actor. For hot paths, batch work
  into one command/transaction instead of spawning many writer messages or
  opening per-row transactions.
- Avoid N+1 store reads. Prefer reader methods that return the data shape the
  caller actually needs, and use cached/prepared statements for repeated
  queries.
- Keep hook ingestion fire-and-forget and bounded. Do not introduce unbounded
  `tokio::spawn` fan-out, unbounded queues, or synchronous agent-facing waits.
- Keep CLI commands thin: parse arguments, resolve config once, call typed
  library functions, render output. Provider-specific behavior belongs in the
  provider module, not in command handlers.
- Treat typed boundaries as load-bearing: IDs, `PagePath`, `AgentKind`,
  sanitization, workspace/project resolution, and provider dialects should be
  parsed or normalized once and reused.
- Preserve workspace/project isolation at shared helper boundaries. Read,
  search, embed, retention, and destructive paths must use no-create lookups
  and fail closed on partial or missing scope; only explicit write/create
  paths may create workspaces or projects.
- Preserve auth boundaries at shared router/helper boundaries. In multi-user
  mode, every `/admin/*` route is root-only; DB-user tokens are for normal
  MCP/API read/write attribution and must not bypass admin gates or admission
  webhooks.
- Prefer explicit fallbacks over `unwrap`, `expect`, or `unreachable!` in
  runtime paths. Panics are acceptable in tests only.
- Do not use `unsafe` for performance work in this project unless profiling
  proves it is necessary and the safety argument is documented in the code.
- Add focused regression tests for bug fixes and behavior changes. For
  filesystem tests, use temp dirs or injected roots; never depend on the real
  user home directory being writable.
- Run the full local gate before claiming a Rust change is ready:
  `cargo fmt --check`, `git diff --check`,
  `TAILWIND_SKIP=1 cargo test --workspace`, and
  `TAILWIND_SKIP=1 cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
